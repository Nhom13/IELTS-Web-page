			<h3><b>Read the text below and answer Questions 1-8</b></h3>
			<center><h1><b><i>London to Brighton Bike Ride</i></b></center>
			<h3><b>The start</b></h3>
			<h3>The bike ride starts at Clapham Common tube station.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Start Time is indicated by the colour of your body number in this
					pack. It is also printed on the address label of the envelope. Please arrive
					no earlier than 30 minutes before that time.
				</li>
				<li>We allocate an equal number of cyclists for each Start Time to ensure a
					steady flow. Please keep to the time you've been given so we can keep to
					our schedule and avoid delaying other riders and prevent 'bunching'
					further down the route.
				</li>
				<li>An Information Point, toilets and refreshment stands will be open from
					very early in the day.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>Ride carefully</b>
			We put together as many facilities as possible to help ensure you have a
			troublefree day. But we also rely on you to ride safely and with due
			onsideration for other cyclists and road users. Although many roads are
			closed to oncoming traffic, this is not always the case and you should be aware
			of the possibility that there could be vehicles coming in the opposite direction.
			Please do not attempt reckless overtaking whilst riding – remember it is NOT a
			race.
		</div align="justify"></p>
		<p><div><b>Follow all instructions</b>
			Every effort is made to ensure that the route is well signed and marshalled.
			Please obey all directions from police and marshals on the route. If you hear a
			motorcycle marshal blow his/her whistle three times, move left.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>Wear a helmet</b>
			Every year we are delighted to see more riders wearing protective helmets, but
			we would like to see every cyclist on the ride wearing one. More than half of
			reported injuries in cycling accidents are to the head, and a helmet gives the
			best protection when the head hits the ground.
		</div ></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>Attracting assistance</b>
				If you have an accident, ask a marshal for help; they are in contact with the
				support/emergency services. To call for help from our motorcycle marshals,
			give a 'thumbs down' signal. The marshal will do all he/she can to help,
			providing he/she is not already going to a more serious accident. If a
			motorcycle marshal slows down to help you, but you have just stopped for a
			rest and don't need help, please give a 'thumbs up' signal and he/she will carry
			on. Remember – thumbs down means 'I need help'.
		</div align="justify"></p>
		<p><div><b>In case of breakdown</b>
			Refer to your route map and make your way to a Mechanics Point. Mechanical
			assistance is free when you show your Rider Identity Card; you just pay for the
			parts.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>Refreshment stops</b>
			Look out for these along the route. Most are organised by voluntary clubs and
			their prices give you real value for money. They are also raising money for their
			local communities and the British Heart Foundation, so please give them your
			support.
		</div align="justify"></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>Rain or shine – be prepared</b>
			In the event of very bad weather, watch out for signs to wet weather stations en
			route. Good waterproofs, like a cycle cape, are essential. Our first aid staff can
			only supply bin liners and by the time you get one you may be very wet.
			However, the English summer is unpredictable – it may also be hot, so don't
			forget the sun protection cream as well!
		</div align="justify"></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>If you have to drop out</b>
			We will try to pick up your bike for you on the day. Call Bike Events (01225
			310859) no more than two weeks after the ride to arrange collection. Sorry, we
			cannot guarantee this service nor can we accept liability for any loss or damage
			to your bike. Bike Events will hold your bike for three months, after which it
			may be disposed of. You will be charged for all costs incurred in returning your
			cycle.

			<center><h1><b><i>THE HISTORY OF TEA</i></b></center>
			<p><div align="justify"><b>A.</b>
			The story of tea began in ancient China over 5,000 years ago. Shen Nong, an early
			emperor, was a skilled ruler, creative scientist and patron ofthe arts. His far-sighted edicts
			required, among other things, that all drinking water be boiled as a hygienic precaution.
			One summer day, while visiting a distant region of his realm, he and the court stopped to
			rest. In accordance with his ruling, the servants began to boil water for the court to drink.
			Dried leaves from a nearby bush fell into the boiling water, and a brown liquid infused
			into the water. As a scientist, the Emperor was interested in the new liquid, drank some,
			and found it very refreshing. And so, according to legend, tea was created. (This myth
			maintains such a practical narrative that many mythologists believe it may relate closely
			to the actual events, now lost in ancient history.)
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>B.</b>
			Tea consumption spread throughout the Chinese culture reaching into every aspect of
			society. In 800 A.D. Lu Yu wrote the first definitive book on tea, the Ch'a Ching. This
			amazing man was orphaned as a child and raised by scholarly Buddhist monks in one of
			China's finest monasteries. However, as a young man, he rebelled against the discipline of
			priestly training which had made him a skilled observer. His fame as a performer
			increased with each year, but he felt his life lacked meaning. In mid-life, he went into
			seclusion for five years. Drawing from his vast memory ofobserved events and places, he
			codified the various methods of tea cultivation and preparation in ancient China. The vast
			definitive nature of his work projected him into near sainthood within his own lifetime.
			Patronized by the Emperor himself, his work clearly showed the Zen Buddhist
			philosophy to which he was exposed as a child. It was this form of tea service that Zen
			Buddhist missionaries would later introduce to imperial Japan.<br>
			The first tea seeds were brought to Japan by the returning Buddhist priest Yeisei, who had
			seen the value of tea in China in enhancing religious mediation. As a result, he is known
			as the "Father ofTea" in Japan. Because of this early association, tea in Japan has always
			been associated with Zen Buddhism. Tea received almost instant imperial sponsorship
			and spread rapidly from the royal court and monasteries to the other sections of Japanese
			society
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>C.</b>
			Tea was elevated to an art form resulting in the creation ofthe Japanese Tea Ceremony
			("Cha-no-yu" or "the hot water for tea"). The best description of this complex art form
			was probably written by the Irish-Greek journalist-historian Lafcadio Hearn, one of the
			few foreigners ever to be granted Japanese citizenship during this era. He wrote from
			personal observation, "The Tea ceremony requires years of training and practice to
			graduate in art...yet the whole of this art, as to its detail, signifies no more than the
			making and serving of a cup of tea. The supremely important matter is that the act be
			performed in the most perfect, most polite, most graceful, most charming manner
			possible".<br>
			Such a purity ofform, ofexpression prompted the creation ofsupportive arts and services.
			A special form of architecture (chaseki) developed for "tea houses", based on the
			duplication of the simplicity of a forest cottage. The cultural/artistic hostesses of Japan,
			the Geishi, began to specialize in the presentation of the tea ceremony. As more and more
			people became involved in the excitement surrounding tea, the purity of the original Zen
			concept was lost. The tea ceremony became corrupted, boisterous and highly embellished.
			"Tea Tournaments" were held among the wealthy where nobles competed among each
			other for rich prizes in naming various tea blends. Rewarding winners with gifts of silk,
			armor, and jewelry was totally alien to the original Zen attitude ofthe ceremony<br>
			Three great Zen priests restored tea to its original place in Japanese society:Ikkyu
			(1394-1481)-a prince who became a priest and was successful in guiding the nobles away
			from their corruption of the tea ceremony.Murata Shuko (1422-1502)-the student of
			Ikkyu and very influential in re-introducing the Tea ceremony into Japanese
			society.Sen-no Rikkyu (1521-1591)-priest who set the rigid standards for the ceremony,
			largely used intact today. Rikyo was successful in influencing the Shogun Toyotomi
			Hideyoshi, who became Japan's greatest patron of the "art of tea". A brilliant general,
			strategist, poet, and artist this unique leader facilitated the final and complete integration
			of tea into the pattern of Japanese life. So complete was this acceptance, that tea was
			viewed as the ultimate gift, and warlords paused for tea before battles.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>D.</b>
			While tea was at this high level of development in both Japan and China, information
			concerning this then unknown beverage began to filter back to Europe. Earlier caravan
			leaders had mentioned it, but were unclear as to its service format or appearance. (One
			reference suggests the leaves be boiled, salted, buttered, and eaten!) The first European to
			personally encounter tea and write about it was the Portuguese Jesuit Father Jasper de
			Cruz in 1560. Portugal, with her technologically advanced navy, had been successful in
			gaining the first right of trade with China. It was as a missionary on that first commercial
			mission that Father de Cruz had tasted tea four years before<br>
			The Portuguese developed a trade route by which they shipped their tea to Lisbon, and
			then Dutch ships transported it to France, Holland, and the Baltic countries. (At that time
			Holland was politically affiliated with Portugal. When this alliance was altered in 1602,
			Holland, with her excellent navy, entered into full Pacific trade in her own right.)
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>E.</b>
			When tea finally arrived in Europe, Elizabeth I had more years to live, and Rembrandt
			was only six years old. Because of the success of the Dutch navy in the Pacific, tea
			became very fashionable in the Dutch capital, the Hague. This was due in part to the high
			cost of the tea (over $100 per pound) which immediately made it the domain of the
			wealthy.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>F.</b>
			Slowly, as the amount of tea imported increased, the price fell as the volume of sale
			expanded. Initially available to the public in apothecaries along with such rare and new
			spices as ginger and sugar, by 1675 it was available in common food shops throughout
			Holland.As the consumption of tea increased dramatically in Dutch society, doctors and
			university authorities argued back and forth as to the negative and/or positive benefits of
			tea. Known as "tea heretics", the public largely ignored the scholarly debate and
			continued to enjoy their new beverage though the controversy lasted from 1635 to
			roughly 1657. Throughout this period France and Holland led Europe in the use oftea.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>G.</b>
			As the craze for things oriental swept Europe, tea became part of the way of life. The
			social critic Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, the Marquise de Seven makes the first mention in
			1680 of adding milk to tea. During the same period, Dutch inns provided the first
			restaurant service of tea. Tavern owners would furnish guests with a portable tea set
			complete with a heating unit. The independent Dutchman would then prepare tea for
			himself and his friends outside in the tavern's garden. Tea remained popular in France for
			only about fifty years, being replaced by a stronger preference for wine, chocolate, and
			exotic coffees. By 1650 the Dutch were actively involved in trade throughout the Western
			world. Peter Stuyvesant brought the first tea to America to the colonists in the Dutch
			settlement of New Amsterdam (later re-named New York by the English). Settlers here
			were confirmed tea drinkers. And indeed, on acquiring the colony, the English found that
			the small settlement consumed more tea at that time then all of England put together.
			Great Britain was the last of the three great sea-faring nations to break into the Chinese
			and East Indian trade routes. This was due in part to the unsteady ascension to the throne
			of the Stuarts and the Cromwellian Civil War. The first samples of tea reached England
			between 1652 and 1654. Tea quickly proved popular enough to replace ale as the national
			drink of England. As in Holland, it was the nobility that provided the necessary stamp of
			approval and so insured its acceptance. King Charles II had married, while in exile, the
			Portuguese Infanta Catherine de Braganza (1662). Charles himself had grown up in the
			Dutch capital. As a result, both he and his Portuguese bride were confirmed tea drinkers.
			When the monarchy was re-established, the two rulers brought this foreign tea tradition to
			England with them.
		</div></p>
		<p><div align="justify"><b>H.</b>
			Imperial Russia was attempting to engage China and Japan in trade at the same time as
			the East Indian Company. The Russian interest in tea began as early as 1618 when the
			Chinese embassy in Moscow presented several chests of tea to Czar Alexis. By 1689 the
			Trade Treaty of Newchinsk established a common border between Russia and China,
			allowing caravans to then cross back and forth freely. Still, the journey was not easy. The
			trip was 11,000 miles long and took over sixteen months to complete. The average
			caravan consisted of 200 to 300 camels. As a result of such factors, the cost of tea was
			initially prohibitive and available only to the wealthy. By the time Catherine the Great
			died (1796), the price had dropped some, and tea was spreading throughout Russian
			society
